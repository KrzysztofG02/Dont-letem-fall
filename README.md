The game (currently) has one level, divided into seven phases. Destroying an enemy grants points to the player who scored the hit. If a square makes contact with the spaceship, 
the enemy is eliminated, but the spaceship takes damage and loses health points.
Depending on the phase, the player faces different types of enemies â€” each with its own color, size, speed, damage and points awarded for eliminating it.

Enemy spawn locations are random, and the ratio of enemy types is not fixed.  
This ensures that each playthrough is slightly different.
